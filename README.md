## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters height and weight.
2. On clicking the **Calculate** button, JavaScript prevents page reload.
3. Inputs are validated to ensure correct values.
4. BMI is calculated using the formula:
   
   BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) × height (m))
   
5. The calculated BMI is displayed along with a weight guide.

## 📱 Responsive Design
The application uses CSS media queries to ensure proper layout and readability on mobile devices.
